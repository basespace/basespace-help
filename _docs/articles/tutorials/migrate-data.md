title: Migrate Data to Subscription Accounts
---

You can migrate project and run data from existing private accounts to workgroups in Professional or Enterprise subscriptions. 

To transfer data to an Enterprise workgroup, both the transferring owner and the receiving owner must be members of the workgroup. 

To enable data transfer to an Enterprise account:

1. Create a workgroup with Enable collaborators outside this domain selected. See [Manage Workgroups](/articles/tutorials/manage-workgroups) for more information.
2. Invite domain members to the workgroup. To simplify transfer management, designate a single user account to receive and accept data ownership requests.
3. Invite the data owner to the workgroup. After they have accepted the workgroup invitation, they can follow the instructions in [Transfer Ownership](/articles/tutorials/transfer-ownership) to transfer the data to a designated user in the workgroup.
