## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.9.0

- Features
  - Added a new API to reschedule an existing automated analysis.
  - Changed the Tumor Normal workflow to send analysis output to the default project associated with the tumor biosample instead of the default project associated with the normal biosample.
- Bugs Fixed
  - Added support to automatically append a number to a transferred project when a project with the same name already exists in the account that received the project.
  - Added pagination to the Public Data page to allow display of all public data when the number of items exceeds the page limit.
  - Fixed issue with the Cufflinks dataset chooser or appresult chooser incorrectly returning zero search results.
- Known Issues
  - Apps using dataset file choosers or dataset choosers containing optional display fields are currently not functioning correctly and have been disabled until fixed.
