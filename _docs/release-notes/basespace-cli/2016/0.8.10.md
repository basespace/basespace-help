##0.8.10 release
Bug fixes

- bs list apps --all-apps was failing with a unicode error
- Importing apps from a json file was not working properly
- It wasn't possible to import an app with a duplicate name, eg. when importing an updated app version - now possible with --force option
- bs kill was not using the proper endpoint to abort apps, which meant that child apps were not being terminated

New features

- New command: bs wait
    - Wait for an appsession to finish, and then resolve it to its output AppResults
    - Can be used to manage dependencies between apps
- Ability to name an app launch with --launch-name switch
- Option to ignore invalid read names on sample upload with --accept-invalid-readnames switch
