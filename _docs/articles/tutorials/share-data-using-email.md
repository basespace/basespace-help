title: How to Share Data using 'Email' option
hide_welcome_banner: true
---

Sharing using the "Share" option allows you to share a Project or Run with a specified collaborator via an email link. Specified collaborators will receive an email with a link to the Project or Run and only that person can view the corresponding data. This option allows greater control over who can view your data as opposed  to sharing using the "Get Link" options which gives anyone  access to your data if the link is left activated.
