## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.40

### Important: Account Data Deletion

- We are turning on data deletion for inactive free accounts that have not logged in for 180 days or more.
- The system will send email notifications to inactive accounts warning them, and users have 30 days to reactivate their accounts by logging in. 

### Features
- Enabled editing run names from either the run details page or the run master list (File | Edit | Run Info).
- Renamed the``Pending Execution`` status to ``Queued for Analysis``, and clarified the status tooltip description on the analysis master page.
- Renamed the run summary ``Avg %Q30`` metric label to ``% â‰¥Q30``.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue that allowed share recipients to update the status of a run.
- We now are calculating project storage size based on Datasets instead of Samples and Appresults, this should be more accurate but may result in changes for some users. Staged roll out, estimated completion is 1/1/2020.
