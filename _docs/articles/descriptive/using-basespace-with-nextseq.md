title: Using BaseSpace with NextSeq
---

BaseSpace is the Illumina analysis cloud environment. BaseSpace facilitates your experiments on the NextSeq system in two different ways:

- BaseSpace helps to organize your samples and experiments, and preps runs for NextSeq.
- BaseSpace stores and analyzes your run data, providing the following benefits:
	- Eliminates the need for on-site storage and computing
	- Enables web-based data management and analysis
	- Provides tools for global collaboration and sharing

If your NextSeq sequencing system and BaseSpace do not connect properly, check the following:

- Make sure that you have a stable connection of at least 10 Mbps upload speed from the NextSeq.
- From the Manage Instrument screen, select **System Configuration** to access a series of screens that configure the connection to BaseSpace.
- Log in to BaseSpace when setting up the run on the NextSeq sequencing system.
