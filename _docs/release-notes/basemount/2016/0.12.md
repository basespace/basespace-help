## 3rd Alpha Release

BaseMount gives the user the ability to mount their BaseSpace data as a Linux-based filesystem.  This allows users to interact with their BaseSpace data programmatically in addition to interacting with it through the BaseSpace User Interface.  

To learn more about BaseMount, please visit the [BaseMount home page](https://basemount.basespace.illumina.com/).

We have also provided a [Help page](https://help.basespace.illumina.com/articles/descriptive/introduction-to-basemount/) for BaseMount which has information on hardware and operation system requirements, directory structure, and current limitations.
