Launching an app is one of the most essential and basic features in the BaseSpace Hub platform.{% callout note, NOTE %}Apps can incur storage, compute, or third-party license fees. If an app terminates due to a BaseSpace Sequence Hub error, fees associated with the terminated run are not charged; if the app is terminated by a user, fees associated with the terminated run are applied. {% endcallout %}
