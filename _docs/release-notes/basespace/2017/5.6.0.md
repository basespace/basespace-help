### New Updates
Our v5.6 release provides a new [Biosample-centric data model](https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_Sequence_Hub/Source/Informatics/BS/DataModel_swBS.htm) and other changes to support [Automation](https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_Sequence_Hub/Source/Informatics/BS/AutomationOverview_swBS.htm) of previously time-consuming tasks. To try the new features, select New on the Dashboard page toggle button, or contact your workgroup owner to turn on the new features for you. [Visit our updated Help site](https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_Sequence_Hub/Source/HomePages/Home_Page_BaseSpace_Sequence_Hub.htm) for more information on the new features and updates.

The new features will be rolling out over the next few days.

  - Added a new v2 version of the REST API for the new entities. The v1 API is still completely supported too.
  - Added the automatic collection of FASTQ data for the same biosamples put in different runs and lanes
  - Added the ability to automate app launch through the creation and use of app templates called [Analysis Workflows](https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_Sequence_Hub/Source/Informatics/BS/AnalysisWorkflows_swBS.htm?Highlight=analysis%20workflow)

  - Updated the downloader client for Mac to work with new BaseSpace Sequence Hub features 
  - Improved consistency of automatically generated folder names when downloading runs 
  - Improved notifications about download status 
  - Added support for downloading using a proxy server 
  - Added capability to download datasets from the Biosample details Datasets tab
- Downloader Bugs Fixed
  - Fixed an issue that could prevent download of SAV data from NovaSeq Runs (fix requires that new BaseSpace Sequence Hub features are enabled for account)
  - Fixed an issue where a file that exceeded available disk space was still allowed do be downloaded
  - Fixed an issue in the the Mac downloader client where the progress bar for queued downloads appeared to show they had already completed
- Known Issues
  - In rare cases, app launch may create a duplicate set of output files for the same appsession. In the case of FASTQ Generation, this  produces an additional FASTQ dataset. BaseSpace Sequence Hub prevents subsequent app launches with the related Biosample in these cases. If this occurs, check the Biosample datasets tab for duplicates, and QC fail one set of duplicates.
  - In some cases, the Run button in app error messages does not launch the app. The app can be launched manually from the GUI.
  - Sample IDs with the same name are aggregated to a single Biosample of the same name. [Automatic data aggregation](https://support.illumina.com/help/BaseSpace_Sequence_Hub/Source/Informatics/BS/AutomaticDataAggregation_swBS.htm?Highlight=data%20aggregation) enables merging of the same sample run across multiple flow cells for downstream processing, however this may result in inaccurate app results if data from different samples with the same sample ID are aggregated to a biosample in error. To prevent unintended aggregation, use unique sample names across all runs. If BaseSpace Sequence Hub detects aggregation upon launching an app, the biosample is locked and must be reviewed and manually unlocked to allow it to proceed with app launch.
  - Selecting biosamples from the biosamples list before launching an app will not carry over the selected biosamples in to the app form. Instead, re-select the biosamples on the app launch page.
  - If you get certain biosample related warning triangles when launching an app from the New mode launch page, the normal behavior of being able to override and launch anyway may not work, preventing launching of the app. If this occurs, switch to Classic mode and launch from the corresponding samples.
