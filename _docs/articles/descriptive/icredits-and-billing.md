BaseSpace Sequence Hub storage, compute, and third-party app costs are charged in iCredits. 

##iCredits
-----
iCredits are the common currency in which BaseSpace Sequence Hub services are priced. iCredits cannot be purchased in advance.

Free Trial accounts and new Professional or Enterprise subscription accounts are granted 250 iCredits that can be used to pay for compute, storage, and third-party apps. Free Trial iCredits expire after 30 days.

Once these promotional iCredits are used, Professional and Enterprise accounts accrue charges in iCredits for storage, compute, and third-party app fees. Usage is invoiced monthly. See [iCredit Currency Conversion](#icredit-conversion) for local currency conversion rates, or [Contact your sales representative]( http://www.illumina.com/forms/contact_request.html?mktofrm=GM-Informatics-Basespace-Website-Contact-Question-2.0-Responsive&sciid=2016019IBN2) for more information.  

Promotional and subscription iCredit charges are rounded up to the nearest iCredit. The BaseSpace Sequence Hub dashboard displays your current iCredit usage.

###Storage

All accounts include a 1 TB<sup>*</sup> storage allowance. Professional and Enterprise accounts are invoiced monthly for storage exceeding 1 TB, at a rate of 0.03 iCredits per GB month. 

Professional and Enterprise accounts can purchase additional storage subscriptions. [Contact your sales representative]( http://www.illumina.com/forms/contact_request.html?mktofrm=GM-Informatics-Basespace-Website-Contact-Question-2.0-Responsive&sciid=2016019IBN2) for more information.

Storage charges are deducted from promotional iCredits at the end of the month. For subscription accounts, storage is tabulated daily. The storage calculation rate is based on a 30-day month.

{% callout note, NOTE %}Basic account customers cannot purchase additional storage. If you need more than 1 TB of storage, [contact your sales representative]( http://www.illumina.com/forms/contact_request.html?mktofrm=GM-Informatics-Basespace-Website-Contact-Question-2.0-Responsive&sciid=2016019IBN2) about upgrading to a Professional or Enterprise account. {% endcallout %}

###Compute
-----
Compute usage is billed at a per-minute rate in iCredits per node hour. The compute rate for an app is displayed on each app's details page.

Compute charges are deducted from promotional iCredits immediately. For subscription accounts, compute is tabulated in real time. 

###Third-Party Apps
-----
You can use iCredits to purchase third-party app subscriptions, analysis, and reports. Price information for third-party services is displayed on each app's details page. 

Third-party app charges are deducted from promotional iCredits at the end of each day. For subscription accounts, third-party app charges are tabulated in real time. For a list of free apps available to Basic accounts, see Basic and Free Trial Accounts.

##Monthly Invoices
-----
For Professional or Enterprise subscription accounts with a valid Purchase Order, Illumina invoices the sum of storage, compute, and third-party app iCredit charges each month. The sum is rounded up to the nearest whole iCredit when the invoice is calculated.

{% callout note, NOTE %}If an app terminates due to a BaseSpace Sequence Hub error, fees associated with the terminated run are not charged; if the app is terminated by a user, fees associated with the terminated run are applied.{% endcallout %}
