Clicking the Runs pane opens the Runs tab. Clicking a run opens the Runs tab with the run loaded.

The right bottom pane of the BaseSpace dashboard shows the most recent app results. Clicking an app result provides charts relevant for the app used in the Projects tab. For more information, see App Results Page.

All in-app purchases are performed using an Illumina currency called iCredits. Before a user can make any in-app purchases, they must add iCredits to their account by purchasing them through BaseSpace. 1 iCredit can be purchased at a rate of 1 USD.
