##Initial Release
First alpha release supporting read-only mounts of BaseSpace Hub metadata and files for:

-  Runs
-  Projects
-  AppResults
-  Samples
-  AppSessions

BaseMount gives the user the ability to mount their BaseSpace Hub data as a Linux-based filesystem.  This allows users to interact with their BaseSpace Hub data programmatically in addition to interacting with it through the BaseSpace Hub User Interface.

We have also provided a [Help page](https://help.basespace.illumina.com/articles/descriptive/introduction-to-basemount/) for BaseMount which has information on hardware and operation system requirements, directory structure, and current limitations.
