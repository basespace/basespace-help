NeoPrep is another option available via the Prep Tab which allows you to plan a run for the NeoPrep instrument.  If you do not have a NeoPrep instrument, you will not see this option in the Prep Tab.

In order to get to the NeoPrep area of BaseSpace Hub, start by clicking **Prep** in the header.  Now, you will see a **NeoPrep** option above the normal Prep tab workflow.  Click on **NeoPrep**.
