##Security
We take security very seriously. Please [this document](http://www.illumina.com/documents/products/technotes/technote_basespace_security.pdf) for details.

## Compliance
We are working towards a number of US and International standards for security. Updates will be provided here of the acreditations we receive.
* HIPPA Compliance Hub - We beleive that our infrastructure is compliant with the various HIPAA regulations. If you are an enterprise customer and are interested in signing a [business associate agreement (BAA)](http://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/covered-entities/sample-business-associate-agreement-provisions/index.html) with us so you can claim HIPAA complance, please contact us.
* HIPPA  Apps - Some of our apps are also HIPAA compatible. Compatible apps are part of the HIPAA app category in BaseSpace Hub, however you still must sign a BAA with us to claim HIPAA compliance. For a list of compatible apps click the "HIPPA" category on our [apps page](https://basespace.illumina.com/apps).
