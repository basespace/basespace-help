- Bugs Fixed

  - Fixed an issue with the file downloader failing to find multi-node FASTQ analysis files.
  - Fixed an issue with the loading spinner on the analysis metrics page continuously displaying after sorting by column header.
  - Fixed an issue that caused miscellaneous (ie, non-manifest) .txt files to be treated as manifest file type instead of misc file type when uploading to a project, resulting in rejection due to failed validation.
