## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.42

### Features
 - The UI file uploader now supports gVCF and gzipped VCF files. 
 - The app input form now displays a notice if a newer version of the app exists.
 - The owner of a biosample can edit the biosample name. To rename the biosample, select the File menu, point to Edit and then select Biosample Info.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed the status field requirement in the POST /v2/libraries/{id} endpoint. The status field is now optional instead of required.
