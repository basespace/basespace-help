To create a new biological sample, the following steps are to be followed:

{% callout note, NOTE %}
Use the import function to create several new samples, see [Import Biological Samples](/articles/tutorials/import-biological-samples/).
{% endcallout %}
<br />
{% step 1, /images/articles/biological-samples-tab_767x321.png, Select Biological Samples %}
Click on the Prep tab and click on Biological samples.
{% endstep %}

{% step 2, /images/tutorials/create-biological-samples-button.png, Click on Create %}
Click the + Create button.
{% endstep %}

{% step 3, /images/tutorials/biological-samples-fields.png, Fill out the fields %}
Fill out the required fields; Sample ID, Name, and Nucleic Acid type. Optionally, you can fill out the Organism (species) field and the Project field. You can also generate a new project. A project is also optional, but if you do not specify it here, you must set it later, because the output data gets stored to the project.
{% endstep %}

{% callout troubleshoot, Please note %}
Sample ID and sample name can only exist of alphanumeric characters, dash, or underscore. Sample ID has to be unique and short; sample name can be more descriptive to provide a human-readable identifier.
{% endcallout %}

When finished, do one of the following:

-	If you only want to select the newly created sample, click the Next: Prep Libraries button. Continue with [Prep Libraries](/articles/descriptive/libraries/).
-	If you want to select multiple samples, click the Save & Continue Later. This selection takes you back to the Biological Samples list, with the recently created sample at the top of the list. Continue with [Use Existing Biological Samples](/articles/tutorials/use-existing-biological-samples/).
