### Release 4.25.1 - May 25, 2017

**FASTQ Generation**

- Updated bcl2fastq to 2.19.1

- Bugs Fixed:
	- Fixed an issue where a small percentage of NextSeq and MiniSeq runs were incorrectly processed such that total number of FASTQ reads generated was reduced (ie, effective yield was reduced). 
		- Illumina is notifying affected users so that they can requeue the appropriate runs if desired.
		- Requeue using the updated version to restore the missing reads.	
	- Fixed an issue where the FastqSummaryF1L# stats file could incorrectly assign non-PF clusters to the non-PF pool for a sample, rather than to the non-PF pool of Undetermined reads.
