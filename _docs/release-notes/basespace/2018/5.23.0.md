## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.26.0 

- Features
  - Added the ability for Enterprise users to publish apps to their domain. Apps published in a domain through the Developer Portal will only show up for users in the domain.
  - The performance of SAV download of run InterOp files has been improved by only downloading aggregated files when available. When aggregated files are not available, per cycle files will downloaded.


- Bugs Fixed
  - Fixed an issue where a user could be prompted with the window to accept an app's EULA after accepting it already.
  - Fixed an issue with workflow analyses getting stuck in "Pending Execution".
