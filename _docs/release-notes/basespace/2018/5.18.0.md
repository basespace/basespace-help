## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.18.0

- Features
  - Added ability to upload any file type to a project.

- Bugs Fixed
  - Fixed an issue that caused analysis summary pages to display miscalculated duration for users in time zones ahead of UTC time. This was a display issue only; billing amounts were calculated correctly.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented download of FASTQ data from a run details page if the sample data was originally output to multiple projects and one of the projects was transferred to a new owner.
  - Fixed personal account settings page with corrected edit profile link and new change password link.
  - Fixed an issue with sample data generated from multi-node FASTQ Generation not appearing in the Run Samples tab when viewed in Classic mode.
  
### Release 5.18.1 - April 20, 2018
- Bugs Fixed
  - Fixed an issue that reduced system performance.
- Known Issue 
  - The v5.18 fix for the multi-node FASTQ Generation display issue was reverted due to performance issues. It will be fixed in a later release.
