## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.17.0

- Features
  - Changed NovaSeq S4 flow cells processed in BSSH New mode to use multi-node FASTQ Generation by default. 
  - Added a setting to specify the number of items shown per page in the runs master list, project biosamples list, and pool libraries list.
  - Updated the look of the run's file browser, including switching the Last Modified date and time column to a Created date and time column.

- Bugs Fixed:
  - Fixed broken hyperlink for general datasets on the biosample's datasets page.
  - Removed inherited permissions from tokens generated by the BaseSpace CLI to limit access token scope to a specific resource.
