## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.43

### Features
 - Prep tab is renamed to Run Planning and includes two menu options: Instrument Run Setup (supporting NextSeq 1000 and NextSeq 2000 systems) and the original Prep page for other systems.
 - Changed billing options for third-party apps. Billing is disabled for new apps and pricing for existing apps cannot be changed.
 - Increased the number of supported characters for adapter sequences to 128.

### Bug Fixes
 - Fixed an issue that would cause an error when a custom name was used for a sample sheet.
 - Fixed an issue in the Move Runs to Trash dialog that allowed more than one option to be selected.
 - Fixed an issue where long app names were shortened in the header of app input forms.
 - Fixed the display of yield records when all data sets are deleted. The yield record is now removed entirely instead of displaying 0 bp.
