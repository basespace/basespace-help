title: How to Use Workgroups
---

After you accept an invitation to join a workgroup, it is available in the Account drop-down list. When you use a workgroup to access BaseSpace Sequence Hub, you use the group account, which may have different data, settings, and resources than your personal account. 

1. Click the Account drop-down arrow, and select a workgroup.
2. 	If you are an admin, you can rename the workgroup as follows.<ol type="a">
<li>From Settings, click **Manage Workgroups**, then click **Overview**.</li>
<li>Click change name.</li>
<li>In the dialog box, enter the new name, and click **Save**.</li></ol>
3. 	To return to your personal account, click the Account drop-down arrow, and select **Personal**.

{% callout note, NOTE %}If you are in your personal account, your name is displayed next to the Account drop-down arrow; if you are in a workgroup, the workgroup name is displayed. {% endcallout %}
