## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.29.0 

- Features
  
  - Added app bookmarks to the app landing page. Bookmarked apps are listed in the sidebar adjacent to the apps list.
  - Added filename validation to uploaded FASTQ files. To prevent potential downstream app failure, the web uploader does not allow filenames that contain special characters.
  - Added email notification when inactive accounts are changed to active status after login.
  - Improved UI
    - Tabbed pages no longer display a subheader if the subheader is a duplicate of the tab name.
    - Initial Lane & QC Status label on the runs page is listed as Initial. Initial status was originally displayed as --.
  - Changed the date display on run sample sheet screen to ISO-compatible format. All date displays in BaseSpace Sequence Hub are now ISO-compatible. 

- Bugs Fixed

  - Fixed an issue that caused problem when attempting to switch workgroups when the window size is small.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented some users from downloading project files when in New mode.
  - Fixed UI element display issues in Safari.
