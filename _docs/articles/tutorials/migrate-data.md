title: Migrate Data to Subscription Accounts
---

You can migrate project and run data from existing private accounts to workgroups in Professional or Enterprise subscriptions.  

##Migrate Data to a Professional Account
To migrate data to or from a Professional workgroup, use [Transfer Ownership](/articles/tutorials/transfer-ownership) to transfer ownership of the data to a designated user in the workgroup. 

##Migrate Data to an Enterprise Account
If you are transferring data to or from an Enterprise workgroup, both the transferring owner and the receiving owner must be members of the workgroup. 

Use the following steps to enable data transfer to an Enterprise account:

1. Create a workgroup and select **Enable collaborators outside this domain** during setup. This option is required to enable data transfers to or from users outside the domain, and cannot be changed after the workgroup is created. See [Manage Workgroups](/articles/tutorials/manage-workgroups) for more information.
2. Invite domain members to the workgroup. To simplify transfer management, designate a single user account to receive and accept data ownership requests.
3. Invite the data owner to the workgroup. After they have accepted the workgroup invitation, they can follow the instructions in [Transfer Ownership](/articles/tutorials/transfer-ownership) to transfer the data to a designated user in the workgroup.
