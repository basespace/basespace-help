##Manage Storage
The Storage page contains two tabs:

- The *Active Storage* tab provides an overview of the total amount of active storage used and free, and the storage by user. Active samples, runs, and analyses are stored on the BaseSpace Hub Onsite system, and can be used for analysis. At the bottom, you see the list of active samples, runs, and analyses stored; you can sort this list by clicking the column headers. Active samples, runs and analyses are stored on the BaseSpace Hub Onsite system, and can be used for analysis.
- The *Archive Storage* tab provides an overview of the archived analyses. Archived samples, runs, and analyses are stored on the archive system, and cannot be used for analysis on BaseSpace Hub Onsite without restoring. At the bottom, you see the list of archived samples, runs, and analyses; you can sort this list by clicking the column headers.

###Archive or Backup Analysis
To archive or backup an analysis, perform the following:

1.      Select the analysis
2.      Click Archive.
3.      A dialog box appears, asking you if you want to keep the data in active storage;

	- If you keep the data in active storage, you can keep working with the analysis, while making a backup in the archive.
	- If you do not keep the analysis in active storage, the data are archived, and you cannot work with the analysis in BaseSpace Hub Onsite. You can always move it back to active storage as described in Restore Analysis on page 68.

Maximum speed for archiving is 25 Mb/s, so it does not interfere with other BaseSpace Hub Onsite tasks.
