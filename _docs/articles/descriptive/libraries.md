This page provides the following actions to prepare your analysis:

- Click a plate, then click the Edit button to edit its properties or libraries.
- Select one or more plates or tubes and move to Pool Libraries.
- Import libraries and associate them to new biological samples at the same time.

{% callout note, NOTE %}
If you want to select multiple libraries:

- Select multiple checkboxes.
- Click anywhere on a library row while holding Ctrl button to add to a selection.
- Click anywhere on a library row while holding Shift button to select all libraries in between.
- Click the checkbox next to Plate/Tube ID to select all samples on the current page.
- Use the import function.

{% endcallout %}

The box next to the Libraries header tracks the total number of libraries, and how many are selected. Click X next to the selection count to clear the current selection.
For more information about these actions, see Prep Libraries or Import Samples and Libraries. When prepping a library, you can also create a custom library kit; see Set Up Custom Library Prep Kit.
