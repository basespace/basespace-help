Use the User Management tab in the Settings window to view and manage users in your domain account. 

##View Users##

View a list of the current users in your domain account.

1. Under User Management, click **Users**.

##Add Users to a Domain Account##

You can allow all users in an email domain to access your BaseSpace Sequence Hub domain account. You might do this to give access to everyone in your company without adding them individually. Do not allow common email domain names, such as gmail.com or hotmail.com.

You can also allow specific users outside your company (for example, a collaborator at a core lab). 

1. Under User Management, click **Allowed Emails**.
2. Enter an email domain name (for example, your-company-email-domain.com), and click **Add**. Do not include the @ symbol.
3. To allow access to specific users, enter the individual email address, and click **Add**.
4. Click **Save Changes**.

##View and Manage User State##

View user account details and verify whether a user is active in the domain. You can also expire a user account to prevent them from logging in to the domain. 

1. Under User Management, click **User State**.
2. In the Set User State window, enter the user's email address, and click **Check**.
3. To expire a user account, select the **Expire User** checkbox, and click **Save**.
4. To restore an expired user account, clear the **Expire User** checkbox, and click **Save**.

##Manage Administrators##

Domain administrators can create workgroups and assign workgroup administrators. Only users who are part of the domain account can be added as administrators.

Use the following steps to add or remove administrators.

1. Under User Management, click **Administrators**.
2. [Optional] Click **Remove** next to an administrators name to remove them.
3. In the Domain administrator window, click **Configure an administrator**.
4. In the **Email** field, enter the email address of the user you want to be a domain administrator, and click **Check**.
5. Enter the user's first and last name, and then click **Save**.
