You can sort the list by clicking the column headers, or click a run to see or edit its properties. For more information about these actions, see Plan Runs.

The runs can have the following states:

- Ready to Sequence: the run can be started from the NextSeq sequencing system.
- Planning, the run does not show up on the NextSeq sequencing system, because it is still in the planning stage.

{% callout note, NOTE %}
If you want to select multiple runs:

- Select multiple checkboxes.
- Click anywhere on a planned run row while holding Ctrl button to add to a selection.
- Click anywhere on a planned run row while holding Shift button to select all runs in between.
- Click the checkbox next Experiment Name to select all planned runs on the current page.

{% endcallout %}

The box next to the Planned Runs header tracks the total number of runs, and how many are selected. Click X next to the selection count to clear the current selection.
When sequencing on a run starts, the run is removed automatically from the Planned Runs list.
