## What's changed for BaseSpace Sequence Hub 5.28.0 

- Features
  - Added more run, status, and QC data to the Run Summary page.
  - Improved file upload to support encrypted manifest (\*.emf) files and AmpliSeq for Illumina manifests.
  - Improved the Analysis Master List display. Column data is automatically resized when the filter widget is activated so that table columns are not obscured.
  - Improved the search function to include flow cell ID. Searching by flow cell ID now returns associated runs even if the run name does not contain the flow cell ID.
  - Updated www.basespace.illumina.com to redirect to the BaseSpace Sequence Hub login page at https://basespace.illumina.com/auth/logon.

- Bugs Fixed

  - Fixed sample pair selection to allow more than one pair to be created via drag and drop.
  - Improved Runs list page loading times. Pages with a large number of rows now load content continuously as you scroll. 
  - Fixed sample pair selection to allow more than one sample pair to be created using drag and drop. 
  - Fixed minor page display issues.
