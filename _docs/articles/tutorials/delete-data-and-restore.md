{% callout note, NOTE %}
Within  Hub, users are able to manage the data in their accounts through a few mechanisms, one of which is the ability to Delete.

BaseSpace Hub Users have the ability to delete:

- Runs
- Projects
- Samples
- Analyses

In order to delete any data from BaseSpace Hub, you must be the owner.  If you delete something that you do not own, it will be removed from your account and you will no longer be a collaborator for that dataset.
